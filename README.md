# Harlequins
**Harlequins is a datapack made in a week for the [Imageination Jam](https://www.planetminecraft.com/jam/imageination/).**  

The theme for this jam, instead of a traditional text prompt, was an image. Specifically *Two Harlequins* by Salvador Dali:

**We suggest that you play through the datapack and experience it yourself before reading the rest of this description.**

The datapack extends the end credits sequence to a series of interactive islands, ranging through the Minecraft versions. This was in part a tribute to Minecraft's 15th Anniversary.  

## Inspiration
The duality of the two figures which dominate the painting inspired a duality of Minecraft, contrasting old and new. Also, the two statues in the painting correspond to the two beings talking in the end credits.

Additionally, the scene appeared to us to be the remains of a once rich and prosperous civilisation, which crumbled over time leaving only two statues to guard over the forgotten land. This gave us the idea to bring you through the Minecraft versions, evolving over time, and finally culminating in a grand city, which crumbles away as the player walks forward in time, leaving the player with an image resembling that of the painting, and completing the journey through time to gain a greater understanding of the Minecraft world.

**This datapack was made by Gears and Moxvallix. Thanks to Wulfian for building the city and the final image.**
